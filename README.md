## Overview

This project is a simple decentralized exchange (DEX) coded in Sui Move that allows users to trade between Ethereum (ETH) and USD Coin (USDC). The project demonstrates the basic functionalities of a DEX on the Sui blockchain, leveraging the power of smart contracts to facilitate secure and trustless token swaps.

## Features

- **Token Swaps**: Users can swap between ETH and USDC directly on the platform.
- **Smart Contract-Based**: All operations are handled via smart contracts on the Sui blockchain, ensuring transparency and security.
- **Sui Move**: The DEX is implemented using Sui Move, a smart contract language optimized for secure and efficient transactions.

## Technologies Used

- **Sui Move**: The core smart contracts are written in Sui Move.
- **Ethereum (ETH)**: One of the supported tokens for trading.
- **USD Coin (USDC)**: Another supported token for trading.
- **Sui Blockchain**: The platform on which this DEX operates.
